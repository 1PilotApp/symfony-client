<p><strong>[You]</strong> What are you, strange being?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Greetings, traveller. I am 1Pilot. I am a tool created to monitor and manage earthbound Symfony applications.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> OK... What is your primary purpose?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> I was created to reduce the time you spend managing applications, so that you can focus on your primary mission.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> Wait, what? How could you know... What is my primary mission?</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> My records indicate that your primary mission is ...searching database... to code in your underwear, jamming to Radiohead.</p>
<p><strong>[You]</strong> ðŸ˜²... ðŸ¤ª... Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>[1Pilot]</strong> Affirmative, traveller. â€˜Sweetâ€™.</p>

... _Introduction protocol complete_ ...

You have just discovered our advanced monitoring tool for your Symfony applications and all the individual sites that you manage. We have designed it as a central dashboard to harmonise the maintenance of your entire website roster. Because we believe that coders should be out there coding. Let computers monitor computers, so that we humans donâ€™t have to worry about it.

We searched the galaxy for a robust answer to our challenges, and found none. So, our team embarked on our greatest mission yet and 1Pilot was born.

## Install

``` bash
composer require 1pilotapp/symfony-client
```

### Symfony 3

1. add to your `app/config/config.yml` file the following configuration keys:
    ```
    one_pilot_client:
        private_key: "%one_pilot_private_key%"
        mail_from_address: "%one_pilot_mail_from_address%"
    ```

2. add to your `app/config/parameters.yml.dist` file the following parameter:
    ```
        one_pilot_private_key: ~
        one_pilot_mail_from_address: ~
    ```
    
   This defines the new required configuration parameter.
    
3. add to your `app/config/parameters.yml` file the following parameter: 

    ```
        one_pilot_private_key: [your key]
        one_pilot_mail_from_address: [mail from address used by verification tool]
    ```
    
    > `one_pilot_private_key` can be any random alphanumeric string. If you are not sure what key to use, go to 1Pilot dashboard and open the page to add a new site: a random key will be generated for you, and you can copy / paste it in your file. Of course you are free to create a totally different key, just make sure you have the same key in your `parameters.yml` and on the 1Pilot dashboard.

    > `one_pilot_email_check_from_address` email address that you use for send mail from your application. It's used by the email verification tool for ensure emails are properly send by your application. 

4. add to your `app/config/routing.yml` the following configuration:
    ```
    one_pilot:
        resource: "@OnePilotClientBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml"
        prefix:   /
    ```

5. add to your `app/AppKernel.php` file, in the `registerBundles` method, the following line:
    ```
    ...
    new OnePilot\ClientBundle\OnePilotClientBundle(),
    ...
    ```

You are now ready to add the site to your [1Pilot dashboard](https://app.1pilot.io/sites/create)!

### Symfony 4

1. add a new `config/packages/one_pilot_client.yaml` file with the following content:
    ```
    one_pilot_client:
        private_key: "%env(ONE_PILOT_PRIVATE_KEY)%"
        mail_from_address: "%env(ONE_PILOT_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS)%"
    ```

2. add to your `.env` file the following parameters:
    ```    
    ONE_PILOT_PRIVATE_KEY=[your key]
    ONE_PILOT_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=[mail from address used by verification tool]
    ```
    > `ONE_PILOT_PRIVATE_KEY` can be any random alphanumeric string. If you are not sure what key to use, go to 1Pilot dashboard and open the page to add a new site: a random key will be generated for you, and you can copy / paste it in your file. Of course you are free to create a totally different key, just make sure you have the same key in your `.env` and on the 1Pilot dashboard. 

    > `ONE_PILOT_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` email address that you use for send mail from your application. It's used by the email verification tool for ensure emails are properly send by your application. 

3. add to your `config/routes.yaml` the following configuration:
    ```
    one_pilot:
        resource: "@OnePilotClientBundle/Resources/config/routing.xml"
        prefix:   /
    ```

You are now ready to add the site to your [1Pilot dashboard](https://app.1pilot.io/sites/create)!

## Advanced configuration
If your server is not at time you can have issue to connect your application to 1Pilot. For solve that edit `app/config/config.yml` and add `skip_timestamp_validation` like bellow.
```
one_pilot_client:
    private_key: "..."
    skip_timestamp_validation: true
```
> Please note that this option will decrease security and that you should as much as possible set your server at the correct time.
